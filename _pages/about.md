 My name is Giovanni and I am a PhD Student in Robotics @ TU Delft in the Netherlands. I grew up in a small town near the Mount Vesuvius in Italy. In 2013, I moved to Milano where I studied Mecchanical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi). In 2018, I obtained my MSc degree with a specialization in Mecchatronics and Robotics with the thesis "On computing second derivatives in optimal motion planning for robot manipulators". In 2019, I moved to the Netherlands in Delft University of Technology to start my PhD in Robotics in the department of Cognitive Robotics under the supervision of Jens Kober. 
My research and expertise focus on control of robot manipulation, learning complex manipulation policies from human demonstration and feedback, bayesian machine learning with a particular focus on Gaussian Process combined with Deep Learning tecniques. I have many hours of experience in programming (real) robot controllers and fitting machine learning models but without forgetting the importance of the theory advancement made with pen and paper.
