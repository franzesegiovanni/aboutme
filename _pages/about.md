 My name is Giovanni and I am a Postdoctoral researcher in Robotics @ TU Delft in the Netherlands. I am currently seeking for a Research Scientist position in Robotics and Machine Learning. I have more than 5 years of experience in Robotics and Machine Learning, with a focus on robot manipulation, learning from human demonstration, and Bayesian machine learning. I am passionate about developing algorithms that enable robots to learn complex manipulation tasks from human demonstration and feedback. I have experience in programming real robot controllers and fitting machine learning models.My controllers for Franka-Emika robots are deployed in my different university around the world and supporting research of scientistis and students. 
  I am a team player and I enjoy working in a multidisciplinary environment. I am looking for a position where I can apply my skills and knowledge to develop innovative solutions for real-world problems in robotics and machine learning.

## Short Bio
I grew up in a small town near the Mount Vesuvius in Italy. In 2013, I moved to Milano where I studied Mechanical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi). In 2018, I obtained my MSc degree with a specialization in Mechatronics and Robotics with the thesis "On computing second derivatives in optimal motion planning for robot manipulators" that I developed in TU Eindhoven. In 2019, I started my PhD in Robotics at the department of Cognitive Robotics of TU Delft in the Netherlands under the supervision of Jens Kober. From September 2022 to February 2023, I was a visiting researcher at the Statistical Machine Learning Group of University College London under the supervision of Marc Deisenroth.
My Ph.D. thesis is entitled "Uncetainty-aware Interactive Imitation Learning for Robot Manipulation" that will be defended in October 2024.
<!-- 
My research and expertise focus on control of robot manipulation, learning complex manipulation policies from human demonstration and feedback, bayesian machine learning with a particular focus on Gaussian Process combined with Deep Learning tecniques.
 I have many hours of experience in programming (real) robot controllers and fitting machine learning models but without forgetting the importance of theory advancement made only with pen and paper.  -->
