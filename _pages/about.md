I am a Senior Researcher in Robotics @ Technology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi. I have six years of experience in Robotics and Machine Learning, with a focus on robot manipulation, learning from human demonstration, and Bayesian machine learning. I am passionate about bringing robots into our daily lives, enabling them to learn from and collaborate with humans
in industrial, warehouse, and service settings. My main research focused on control and learning strategies for safe
and efficient robot learning, with applications in single‑arm and bimanual manipulation from different perception inputs, i.e. proprioceptive, tactile, RGB, keypoint and pointclouds. I promote manipulation strategies that can be fully learned from human demonstrations and corrections. And I demonstrated the effectiveness of this interactive learning approach by successfully tackling and winning various robot competitions. I have led multidisciplinary projects on robot dressing, assembly and disassembly tasks, surface polishing, and warehouse automation. I foster knowledge‑sharing among my collaborators, thriving in an environment of healthy competition. I am a strong proponent of developing and validating solutions on real robotic hardware.
