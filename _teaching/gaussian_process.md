The course will cover the basics of Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and will provide an overview of the most recent advances in GP-based machine learning. The course will also cover the application of GP to robot learning from demonstration, robot manipulation, and reinforcement learning. The course will be a mix of theoretical lectures and practical exercises. The students will be required to implement GP-based algorithms in Python and apply them to real-world problems in robotics. The course is yearly held in the third trimester in TU Delft in the Course Intelligent Control Systems.
